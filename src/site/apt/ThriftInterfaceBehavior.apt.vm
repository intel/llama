Llama - Thrift Interface Behavior

* Llama Client Registration Protocol

  When registering a client must present a client-ID <<<UUID>>> and a callback <<<HOST:PORT>>>.

  For a new registration, a new handle <<<UUID>>> will be returned to the client if the registration was successful.

  However, if the client is doing a re-registration (because of a stale Thrift connection, a client restart, a Llama restart, etc) the following protocol must be observed:

*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------*-------------------*
|<<Client-ID UUID>>|<<Callback HOST:PORT>>|<<Returned handle>>|<<Llama behavior>>|<<Client behavior>>|
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+
|NEW               |NEW                   |NEW                | There is no previous state associated with the handle | There is no previous Llama state associated with the handle |
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+
|NEW               |EXISTING              |NEW                | Previous state with the existing handle is erased | Client should not have a prior Llama state as it provided a new client-ID |
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+
|EXISTING          |NEW                   |<<ERROR>>          | Registration is rejected, existing state associated with the handle remains valid | Client either use a new client-ID with a clean Llama state or provide the same client-ID preserving existing Llama state |
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+
|EXISTING          |EXISTING              |EXISTING           | Existing state associated with the handle remains valid. The client-ID and callback must be associated to the same handle, else it is an ERROR | Client should known have existing Llama state for the handle |
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+
|EXISTING          |EXISTING              |NEW                | There is no previous state associated with the handle | Client should discard all previous Llama state as it is not valid anymore |
*------------------*----------------------*-------------------*------------------+-------------------+

* Llama Client Notifications
